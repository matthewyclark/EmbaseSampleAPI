This could lead to suboptimal risk minimization strategies. Objective: To systematically assess the variation in the extent and content of information on QT prolongation in the summary of product characteristics (SPC) of recently approved medicinal products. Methods: Drug labels of products centrally approved in Europe between 2006 and 2012 were screened. Of drugs including the term 'QT' in the SPC, the message on QT-prolongation ('no prolongation'/'unclear drug-QT association'/'possibly QT-prolongation'/'QT-prolongation') and the advice on cautionary measures pertaining to QT-prolongation in the label were examined, as well as their association. Results: Of the 175 screened products, 44 contained information on QT in the SPC ('no QT-prolongation': 23%, 'unclear drug-QT association': 43%, 'possibly QT-prolongation': 16%, 'QT-prolongation': 18%). 62% contained advices to act with caution in patients with additional risk factors for QT-prolongation. Products that more likely to have QT-prolonging properties according to the SPC provided more information on QT-prolongation in the SPC ('no prolongation': 10% and for the category 'QT-prolongation': 100%). Conclusions: The extent and content of information on QT-prolongation varies considerably between SPCs, and in almost half of the drugs a clear message on QT-prolongation was lacking in the SPC. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"Int.

Very little data is available about this side effect in the literature and it is only fundamental data [1]. We decided to explore the hydroxyzine risk of QT prolongation in real-life conditions. Material and methods: Primarily, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the impact of hydroxyzine on hospitalized patients QT, and we analyzed data of patients concerned by this side effect. Then we performed a descriptive study of QT prolongation reports with hydroxyzine in the French PharmacoVigilance database. Lastly, we did a comparative study of QT prolongation with H1-antihistamines in VIGIBASE®. Results: We included 37 patients in the cohort of the prospective study. Among them 7 patients presented a QT prolongation. They all had other risk factors of QT prolongation such as renal insufficiency or use of other drug known to prolong QT. We found 42 cases of QT prolongation imputed to hydroxyzine in the French Pharmacovigilance data base. In all cases, there were other risk factors of QT prolongation. Fourteen H1-antihistamines out of the 24 investigated were associated with a significant ROR value. For 7 of them, QT prolongation was indicated in the side effects section of the SMPC (Summary of Product Characteristics) and 4 were listed in CREDIBLEMEDS® list. Discussion/Conclusion: The prospective study demonstrated that hydroxyzine common use in patient with risk factors of QT prolongation greatly increases the risk of QT prolongation. This was confirmed by data found in the French PharmacoVigilance database. In our comparative study in VIGIBASE®, QT prolongation was associated with most H1-antihistamines while this risk was only described in the literature for some of them. These studies have strong arguments supporting the noxious effect of hydroxyzine and more widely of all H1-antihistamines on QT and shows that QT prolongation might be a class effect of H1-antihistamines. Hydroxyzine prescription should be used with caution in patients with QT prolongation risk factors. We intend to communicate further information to prescribers to ensure the best possible care of patients treated with hydroxyzine."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"Fundam.

appropriate assessment of QT prolongation remains controversial. We suggest that before the relative merits of various methods can be evaluated, we must state what we assume an assessment of QT prolongation should be about. As a general framework for the assessment of QT prolongation we propose that an assessment of \"absolute\" or \"uncorrected\" QT prolongation is properly carried out through a between-treatment (active versus placebo) comparison of the marginal distributions of QT data; an assessment of \"heart rate corrected\" QT prolongation is carried out through a between-treatment comparison of the conditional distributions of QT data (conditional on RR interval or heart rate). Under this general framework, conditional QT prolongation is, in general, a function of RR interval, and we discuss three possible summary characteristics for that function. We show how current procedures for the assessment of QT prolongation relate to the general approach (that is, to betweentreatment contrasts of the marginal and conditional expectation of the QT interval), and to each other. It transpires that only the so-called \"one-step procedure\" can provide a complete characterization of conditional QT prolongation. We show that the \"two-step procedure\" with data-driven correction provides an unbiased estimate of expected conditional QT prolongation, which may, from a clinical point of view, be a more satisfactory characteristic than the conventional characteristic, QT prolongation at the reference RR interval. We strongly suggest that two-step procedures with fixed correction be abandoned in the analysis of thorough QT/QTc studies: Fixed correction is either redundant (when a drug has no effect on average RR interval), or systematically biased (when a drug does affect average RR interval).

QT-interval prolongation is one of the most common adverse drug reactions leading to regulatory action. Although the occurrence of QT prolongation is generally rare, it can be potentially fatal by causing ventricular arrhythmia. We have noticed that information regarding QT prolonging properties of drugs varies between different sources. Objective: To compare the QT prolonging properties described in the European and American drug label. Methods: The European and American drug labels of products that were centrally approved in Europe between 1.1.2006 and 1.5.2012 were screened. Of those mentioning 'QT', we determined the nature of the message on QT prolongation (no prolongation/unclear drug-QT association/ potentially QT prolongation/QT prolongation). The kappa statistic was calculated to estimate the agreement between the message in the European SPC and the American drug label. Results: Of the 172 selected products approved in Europe, 30 products were not approved by the FDA (44 %). A quarter of the products reported on QT prolongation in both the European and the American drug label (n = 36/142). In one-fifth of the products (n = 28/142), only the American drug label reported on QT prolongation, of which 24 (86 %) contained a negative message (drug does not prolong the QT interval). Two products reported only in the European drug label on QT prolongation (1 %). The agreement on the message about QT prolongation between the European and USA drug label was moderate (kappa 0.42). There was a tendency for the FDA drug label to be more explicit on drug-associated QT prolongation than the European SPC (Unclear message on QT prolongation: FDA 6 %, EMA 12 %). One drug had no QT prolonging properties according to the European label of the EMA, while this drug did prolong the QT interval according to the American label. Conclusion: This study showed that there was moderate concordance between the nature of the QT prolonging effect described in the European and American drug label.

In 2012, the FDA issued Drug Safety Communications on several drugs associated with QT prolongation and fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Among these was citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As minimal research has assessed drug-related QT prolongation in patients with severe mental illnesses, this study explores psychotropic drugs associated with QT prolongation among Veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Methods: Patients with PTSD in the Veterans Health Administration in 2006-2009 were reviewed, identifying 176 Veterans diagnosed with QT prolongation. Cases were matched 1:4 on age, gender, visit date and setting, and physical comorbidity. Classification trees assessed QT prolongation risk among prescribed medications for the combined sample (N= 880). Finally, five-year survival by prolonged QT status was analyzed. Results: Receipt of any drug with known risk of QT prolongation varied by group (23% QT vs. 15% control, p< 0.01). Psychotropic medications conferring significant risks included the antipsychotic ziprasidone (3% vs. 1%, p= 0.02) and the anxiolytic buspirone (6% vs. 2%, p= 0.01) but not the SSRIs citalopram and fluoxetine. Classification trees found sotalol and the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline carried greater risk among cardiac patients, and methadone, especially if prescribed with quetiapine, among non-cardiac patients. Per preliminary adjusted survival model, patients with QT prolongation were at increased risk for mortality (HR= 1.60; 95% CI: 1.04- 2.44). Conclusions: Decision models are particularly advantageous when exploring nonlinear relationships or non-additive interactions. These findings may potentially impact clinical decision-making concerning treatment for PTSD. For patients at higher risk of QT prolongation, antidepressants other than amitriptyline should be considered. Medications for comorbid conditions should also be closely monitored for heightened risk of QT prolongation. This study further highlights the importance of routine use of electrocardiograms for QT monitoring among patients with PTSD taking these agents."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Value in

Drug-induced QT prolongation can cause life-threatening arrhythmia. However, postmarketing surveillance based on spontaneous reporting systems has a limited ability to detect QT prolongation signal due to the rare incidence and reports.We hypothesized that a surveillance system based on electronic health records (EHRs) could be used to detect the signal because EHRs collect most of the clinical events in a hospital. Objectives: To develop a QT prolongation signal surveillance system using EHR data. Methods: We developed a QT prolongation surveillance system linked to the EHR database of a Korean tertiary teaching hospital. The database contains 15 years of ECG, clinical, and prescription data. The system performed a predefined case-crossover study. From the database, we selected 6,326 subjects (age 20-59 years) who had incident QT prolongation. For each subject, one case and one control period were matched. The drug prescribed in the 24-hour case period just before the event was compared with the drug in an earlier 24-hour control period, separated by a 72-hour washout period. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), after adjusting for hospitalization and concomitant drugs known to be related to QT prolongation. A lower margin of the 95% CI >2 was considered a positive signal. To evaluate the system performance, 20 drugs were selected: 13 known to cause QT prolongation and seven others. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. The time required for analysis was also checked. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the system were 92.3, 71.4, 85.7, and 83.3%, respectively. On average, only 54 minutes were required to analyze one drug. Conclusions: The developed system was fully automated and successfully detected QT prolongation signals with good performance and short analysis time using the linked EHR data. The system should be useful for surveillance of QT prolongation caused by marketed drugs."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"Pharmacoepidemiol.

Drug induced QT prolongation has been associated with ventricular arrhythmias, Torsade de Pointes, and death. Limited data exists on the incidence of drug induced QT prolongation, its pro-arrhythmic effects, and associated risk factors in hospitalized children. Methods: We performed a retrospective study looking at all children admitted to our institution from January 2005 to December 2009 who received known QT prolonging medications (www.qtdrugs.org). Patients with known congenital Long QT Syndrome or other known exogenous causes of QT prolongation were excluded. Results: During the study period, there were 102,343 admissions to our institution. Of those, 33,332 pts (32.6%) received at least one known QT prolonging medication with 5,189 (15.6%) having an ECG performed during drug administration. Of pts screened while receiving QT prolonging medications, 7.3% (377) had QT prolongation (QTc>450msecs) and 2.1% (110) had marked QT prolongation (QTc>500msecs). Of those with documented QT prolongation, 41 (10.9%) had a ventricular arrhythmia, 10 (2.7%) had Torsades or VF arrest, and 5 (1.3%) had sudden cardiac death. Demographic factors, including age and gender were not associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias or death. Receiving multiple QT prolonging medications was also not associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias or death. Class 1 QT prolonging medications (those generally accepted to carry a risk of Torsades) were associated with marked QT prolongation (p=0.01) and an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias with 22/104 (21.1%) of pts experiencing VT or VF (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.9 to 7.0)(p<0.001). Class of QT prolonging medication (p=0.42) and marked QT prolongation (p=0.54) were not however associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Conclusions: The administration of QT prolonging medications is common in children admitted for treatment to a tertiary care hospital. Ventricular arrhythmias are not rare in hospitalized children with drug induced QT prolongation, and those receiving Class 1 agents with marked QT prolongation are at greatest risk."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Heart Rhythm"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"Heart

QT prolongation is associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Previous studies have suggested increased prevalence of QT prolongation in end stage liver disease (ESLD) patients. Methods: We aimed to determine the prevalence of QT prolongation in a large series of ESLD patients and its association to clinical variables and mortality. The QT interval was measured and corrected for heart rate for each patient, with a prolonged QT cutoff defined as QT > 450 msec for males and QT > 470 msec for females. Multiple clinical variables were evaluated including sex, age, serum sodium, international normalized ratio, creatinine, total bilirubin, beta-blocker use, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-Na, and etiology of liver disease. Results: Among 406 ESLD patients analyzed, 207 (51.0%) had QT prolongation. The only clinical variable associated with QT prolongation was male gender (OR 3.04, 95% CI 2.01-4.60, p < 0.001). During the study period, 187 patients (46.1%) died. QT prolongation was a significant predictor of mortality (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03-2.77, p=0.039). In addition, mortality was also associated with viral etiology of ESLD, elevated MELD score and its components (P < 0.05 for all). Conclusions: QT prolongation was commonly encountered in an ESLD population and served as strong marker for increased mortality.

Typically detected via electrocardiograms (ECGs), QT interval prolongation is a known risk factor for sudden cardiac death. Since medications can promote or exacerbate the condition, detection of QT interval prolongation is important for clinical decision support. We investigated the accuracy of natural language processing (NLP) for identifying QT prolongation from cardiologist-generated, free-text ECG impressions compared to corrected QT (QTc) thresholds reported by ECG machines. Methods: After integrating negation detection to a locally developed natural language processor, the KnowledgeMap concept identifier, we evaluated NLP-based detection of QT prolongation compared to the calculated QTc on a set of 44,318 ECGs obtained from hospitalized patients. We also created a string query using regular expressions to identify QT prolongation. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of the methods using manual physician review of the cardiologist-generated reports as the gold standard. To investigate causes of \"false positive\" calculated QTc, we manually reviewed randomly selected ECGs with a long calculated QTc but no mention of QT prolongation. Separately, we validated the performance of the negation detection algorithm on 5000 manually categorized ECG phrases for any medical concept (not limited to QT prolongation) prior to developing the NLP query for QT prolongation. Results: The NLP query for QT prolongation correctly identified 2364 of 2373 ECGs with QT prolongation with a sensitivity of 0.996 and a positive predictive value of 1.000. There were no false positives. The regular expression query had a sensitivity of 0.999 and positive predictive value of 0.982. In contrast, the positive predictive value of common QTc thresholds derived from ECG machines was 0.07-0.25 with corresponding sensitivities of 0.994-0.046. The negation detection algorithm had a recall of 0.973 and precision of 0.982 for 10,490 concepts found within ECG impressions. Conclusion: NLP and regular expression queries of cardiologists' ECG interpretations can more effectively identify QT prolongation than the automated QTc intervals reported by ECG machines. Future clinical decision support could employ NLP queries to detect QTc prolongation and other reported ECG abnormalities. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

and Purpose QT prolongation independently predicts adverse cardiovascular events in suspected poisoning. We aimed to evaluate the association between race and drug-induced QT prolongation for patients with acute overdose. Methods This was a cross-sectional observational study at two urban teaching hospitals. Consecutive adult ED patients with acute drug overdose were prospectively enrolled over a two year period. The primary outcome, long-QT, was defined using standard criteria: QTc > 470 ms in females and > 460 ms in males. The association between race and drug-induced QT prolongation was tested, considering several confounding variables. Results In 472 patients analyzed (46% female, mean age 42.3), QT prolongation occurred in 12.7%. Blacks had two-fold increased odds of drug-induced QT prolongation (OR 2.01, CI 1.03-3.91) and Hispanics had 48% decreased odds of drug-induced QT prolongation (OR 0.52, CI 0.29-0.94).

Sotalol (S) prolongs the cardiac action potential that can be observed as QT interval (QT) prolongation on the surface EKG. It is known that S causes Torsade de Pointes ventricular tachycardia (TdP) that is due to dose related QT prolongation. We were able to develop a correlation between QT prolongation and S serum concentration. Methods: 15 healthy volunteers (age: 32±8 y) received 75 mg intravenous S over 2.5 hr at a constant infusion rate. Serum S concentrations were determined and a 12-lead EKG was recorded at baseline, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hrs following dosing. The QT and RR intervals were measured by two blinded investigators. Heart rate corrected QT (QTc) was calculated by the Bazett (B), Fridericia (Fi), and Framingham (Fh) formulas. Linear regression analysis was performed between S concentration and QT measurements. Results: The analysis showed close correlation between S concentration and QT (r=0.938, p<0.02), B QTc (r=0.860, p<0.02), Fh QTc (r=0.960, p=0.001), and Fi QTc (r=0.967, p<0.001). The equation of the regression line was: QTc= 0.0388 x (S concentration) + 402.63, which closely predicted actual QTc at any S concentration. Conversely any degree of QT prolongation can predict the measured serum S concentration. Conclusions: A simple equation was found that predicts serum S concentration from QT prolongation. Measuring QT prolongation can yield a quick method of estimating serum S concentration as well as the electrophysiologic effects of serum S. Excessive serum S levels that causes increased QT prolongation can be avoided, possibly reducing the risk of TdP.

Information is lacking on the frequency of QT prolongation due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) accounting for temporal sequence in intensive care units (ICUs). This evaluation is of particular interest to clinicians in cardiac ICUs, since there is at heightened risk for adverse outcomes. The primary objective was to determine the frequency of QT prolongation from potentially interacting drugs in the coronary ICU and cardiothoracic ICU. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation was performed using the institution's electronic data repository. Inclusion criteria were admission to the cardiac ICUs between January 2009 and July 2009, age ≥ 18 years, and electrocardiographic (EKG) evidence of a QTc ≥ 500 ms. Medications known to prolong the QT interval were identified using the Arizona CERT database. Patients receiving two concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval were considered to experience a pharmacodynamic DDI. Medications known to be CYP450 enzyme inhibitors of QT prolonging medications were considered to cause pharmacokinetic DDIs. Interactions were evaluated for temporal relationship and causality related to the QT prolongation. RESULTS: 187 (54.5 % male) patients, with a mean age of 62 years, experienced QT prolongation out of a total of 501 patients (37%) admitted during the study period. 154 and 163 patients had a potential pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction, respectively, receiving an average of 2.9 QT prolonging medications during their admission. Of these patients, 43% (66/154) had 133 pharmacodynamic interactions confirmed by temporal sequence, and 47% (77/163) of patients experienced 179 potential pharmacokinetic interactions temporally related to QT prolongation. CONCLUSION: DDIs may be a significant cause of QT prolongation in cardiac ICUs. These data can be used to educate clinicians on safe medication use. Computerized clinical decision support could be applied to aid in the detection of these events."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Pharmacotherapy"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"Pharmacotherapy","issn":[{"issnType":"print","issNnr":"02770008"}],"isbn":null,"volisspag":{"volume":"31","issue":"10","supplement":null,"firstPage":"312e","lastPage":"313e","pages":null},"articleNumber":null,"publicationYear":"2011","publicationDate":{"pubDateText":"October

antihistamines, such as mizolastine and ebastine, can prolong the QT interval and provoke severe cardiac arrhythmias. This review examines the effects of two widely used antihistamines, cetirizine and loratadine, on the QT interval. • As of mid 2009 very few clinical data had been published on the risk of QT prolongation with cetirizine or loratadine. • The very rare reported cases of torsades de pointes linked to loratadine mainly appear to involve drug interactions, especially with amiodarone and enzyme inhibitors. • We found no reports of QT prolongation attributed to desloratadine, the main metabolite of loratadine. • Two cases of QT prolongation with cetirizine have been published, one of which involved overdose and renal failure. The reports are too vague to conclude that cetirizine was implicated. • We found no reports of QT prolongation attributed to levocetirizine. • Cetirizine is a metabolite of hydroxyzine, another antihistamine. In the 1960s, a study of patients with psychosis showed a risk of QT prolongation. A case of recurrent syncope with QT prolongation has since been reported, along with rare cases of cardiac arrhythmia. • In practice, cetirizine and loratadine are first-line antihistamines. However, caution is needed in certain circumstances. In particular, it is best that patients who have risk factors for torsades de pointes or who are taking certain enzyme inhibitors avoid using loratadine.

To test the potential value of more frequent QT interval measurement in hospitalized patients. Design: We performed a prospective, observational study. Setting: All adult intensive care unit and progressive care unit beds of a university medical center. Patients: All patients admitted to one of six critical care units over a 2-month period were included in analyses. Interventions: All critical care beds (n = 154) were upgraded to a continuous QT monitoring system (Philips Healthcare). Measurements and Main Results; QT data were extracted from the bedside monitors for offline analysis. A corrected QT interval >500 msecs was considered prolonged. Episodes of QT prolongation were manually over-read. Electrocardiogram data (67,648 hrs, mean 65 hrs/patient) were obtained. QT prolongation was present in 24%. There were 16 cardiac arrests, with one resulting from Torsade de Pointes (6%). Predictors of QT prolongation were female sex, QT-prolonging drugs, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, high creatinine, history of stroke, and hypothyroidism. Patients with QT prolongation had longer hospitalization (276 hrs vs. 132 hrs, p < .0005) and had three times the odds for all-cause in-hospital mortality compared to patients without QT prolongation (odds ratio 2.99 95% confidence interval 1.1-8.1). Conclusions: We find QT prolongation to be common (24%), with Torsade de Pointes representing 6% of in-hospital cardiac arrests. Predictors of QT prolongation in the acutely ill population are similar to those previously identified in ambulatory populations. Acutely ill patients with QT prolongation have longer lengths of hospitalization and nearly three times the odds for mortality then those without QT prolongation.

However, there is little information available on pediatric patients with QT prolongation and their outcomes. Herein, we evaluated the prevalence of QT prolongation in pediatric patients identified by an institution-wide QT alert system, and the spectrum of their phenotype. Patients with documented QT prolongation on an ECG obtained between November 2010 and June 2011 were included. There were 1303 pediatric ECGs, and 68 children had electrographically isolated QT prolongation. Comprehensive review of medical records was performed with particular attention to QT-prolonging clinical, laboratory, and medication data, which were summarized into a pro-QTc score. Overall, 68 (5 %) pediatric patients had isolated QT prolongation. The mean age of this pediatric cohort was 9 ± 6 years, and the average QTc was 494 ± 42 ms. All children had 1 or more QT-prolonging risk factor(s), most commonly QT-prolonging medications. One patient was identified with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), which was not previously diagnosed. In one-year follow-up, only one pediatric death (non-cardiac) occurred (1.5 %). Potentially QT-offending/pro-arrhythmic medications were changed in 80 % of pediatric patients after the physician received the QT alert. Children with QT prolongation had very low mortality and minimal polypharmacy. Still, medications and other modifiable conditions were the most common causes of QT prolongation. Children with a prolonged QTc should be evaluated for modifiable QT-prolonging factors. However, if no risk factors are present or the QTc does not attenuate after risk factor modification/removal, the child should be evaluated for congenital LQTS."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Pediatric Cardiology"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"Pediatr.

Over 50 medications cause QT prolongation, which can deteriorate into torsade de pointes. Information is lacking on the frequency of QT prolongation due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) accounting for temporal sequence in intensive care units (ICUs). This evaluation is of particular interest to clinicians in cardiac ICUs, since there is at heightened risk for adverse outcomes. Hypothesis: The primary objective was to determine the frequency of QT prolongation from potentially interacting drugs in the coronary ICU and cardiothoracic ICU. Methods: After obtaining IRB approval, a retrospective evaluation was performed using the institution's electronic data repository. Inclusion criteria were admission to the cardiac ICUs between January 2009 and July 2009, age ≥18 years, and electrocardiographic (EKG) evidence of a QTc ≥ 500 ms. Medications known to prolong the QT interval were identified using the Arizona CERT database. Patients receiving 2 concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval were considered to experience a pharmacodynamic DDI. Medications known to be CYP450 enzyme inhibitors of QT prolonging medications were considered to cause pharmacokinetic DDIs. Interactions were evaluated for temporal relationship to the QT prolongation. Results: 187 (54.5 % male) patients, with a mean age of 62 years, experienced QT prolongation out of a total of 501 patients (37%) admitted during the study period. 154 and 163 patients had a potential pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction, respectively, receiving an average of 2.9 QT prolonging medications during their admission. Of these patients, 43% (66/154) had 133 pharmacodynamic interactions confirmed by temporal sequence, and 47% (77/163) of patients experienced 179 potential pharmacokinetic interactions temporally related to QT prolongation. Most common medications related to these DDIs were amiodarone, ondansetron, tacrolimus, diphenhydramine, voriconazole, risperidone and haloperidol. Conclusions: DDIs may be a significant cause of QT prolongation in cardiac ICUs. These data can be used to educate clinicians on safe medication use. Computerized clinical decision support could be applied to aid in the detection of these events."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Critical Care Medicine"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"Crit.

objectives of this paper are to: 1) discuss practical aspects of antipsychotic induced QT prolongation, torsades de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death, 2) discuss its possible mechanisms, 3) review data for each antipsychotic medication or class of medications and, 4) present recommendations from the literature. We performed computerized searches of the biomedical literature utilizing MEDLINE and PsycINFO computer databases (1966-2001), and by reviewing bibliographies to identify all pertinent case reports, case series, and formal studies using the following search terms: antipsychotics, sudden cardiac death, and QT prolongation. QT prolongation is a dynamic phenomena affected by various factors (mood, disease states, gender, medication, etc.). Sudden cardiac death attributable to antipsychotic medications seems to occurs in a step-wise fashion beginning with QT prolongation, leading to TdP, which can progress to cardiac arrest. Blocking the rapidly-acting potassium rectifier current appears be the primary mechanism of QT prolongation in drugs known to cause TdP and sudden cardiac death. All antipsychotic medications have been shown to cause QT prolongation, however, the degree to which this occurs and the risk of TdP varies. The risk of sudden cardiac death increases with higher doses of medications, use of phenothiazines or intravenous butyrophenones, and in patients with certain medical illnesses, especially cardiac disease. In order to prevent sudden death from antipsychotic medications, we recommend obtaining screening electrocardiograms in all at-risk patients, follow-up electrocardiograms after the initiation of medication, and using the lowest effective dose of medication. If QT prolongation occurs, the risks and benefits of therapy should be considered and medication adjustments made if warranted."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Psychopharmacology bulletin"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"Psychopharmacol Bull","issn":[{"issnType":"print","issNnr":"00485764"}],"isbn":null,"volisspag":{"volume":"36","issue":"3","supplement":null,"firstPage":"91","lastPage":"99","pages":null},"articleNumber":null,"publicationYear":"2002","publicationDate":{"pubDateText":null,"pubDate":{"year":"2002","month":"06","day":"01","content":"2002-06-01"}}},"enhancement":{"descriptors":{"disease":[{"weight":"a","mainterm":{"candidate":null,"content":"long QT syndrome"},"disterm":"long QT syndrome","drgterm":null,"devterm":null,"link":null,"ancestor":["cardiac channelopathy","cardiovascular disease","channelopathy","diseases","heart arrhythmia","heart disease","heart muscle conduction disturbance","long qt syndrome","physical disease","physical disease by anatomical structure","physical disease by etiology and pathogenesis"],"explodedFrom":null},{"weight":"b","mainterm":{"candidate":null,"content":"sudden cardiac death"},"disterm":"sudden cardiac death","drgterm":null,"devterm":null,"link":null,"ancestor":["cardiovascular disease","death","diseases","general aspects of disease","heart arrest","heart disease","heart failure","physical disease","physical disease by anatomical structure","sudden cardiac death","sudden death"],"explodedFrom":null},{"weight":"a","mainterm":{"candidate":null,"content":"torsade des pointes"},"disterm":"torsade des pointes","drgterm":null,"devterm":null,"link":null,"ancestor":["cardiovascular disease","diseases","heart arrhythmia","heart disease","heart muscle conduction disturbance","physical disease","physical disease by anatomical structure","torsade des pointes"],"explodedFrom":null}],"device":[],"other":[{"weight":"b","mainterm":{"candidate":null,"content":"electrocardiography"},"disterm":null,"drgterm":null,"devterm":null,"link":null,"ancestor":["cardiography","cardiovascular system examination","diagnosis","diagnostic procedure","electrocardiography","electrodiagnosis","electrography","medical procedures","procedures","procedures, parameters and devices"],"explodedFrom":null},{"weight":"b","mainterm":{"candidate":null,"content":"human"},"disterm":null,"drgterm":null,"devterm":null,"link":null,"ancestor":["amniote","animal","ape","bilateria","catarrhini","chordata","deuterostomia","euarchontoglires","eukaryote","haplorhini","hominid","human","human versus nonhuman data","mammal","opisthokonta","organisms","placental mammal","primate","simian","tetrapod","therian","types of article or study","types of study","vertebrate"],"explodedFrom":null},{"weight":"b","mainterm":{"candidate":null,"content":"risk factor"},"disterm":null,"drgterm":null,"devterm":null,"link":null,"ancestor":["danger, risk, safety and related phenomena","environment","risk","risk factor","society and environment"],"explodedFrom":null}],"drug":[{"weight":"b","mainterm":{"candidate":null,"content":"neuroleptic agent"},"disterm":null,"drgterm":"neuroleptic agent","devterm":null,"link":null,"ancestor":["central nervous system agents","chemicals and drugs","neuroleptic agent","psychotropic agent","tranquilizer"],"explodedFrom":null}]}},"authorList":{"authors":[{"initials":"M.O.","surname":"Harrison"},{"initials":"K.R.","surname":"Krishnan"}]}},"relatedArticles":"L611776600/sim"},{"openLink":null,"itemInfo":{"kind":"regular","itemIdList":{"pii":null,"doi":"10.1002/pds.3512","lui":"L71244473","pui":"71244473","associatedlui":null,"associatedpui":null,"medl":null,"embase":null},"history":{"dateCreated":"2013-12-04","dateLoaded":"2013-12-06"},"dbCollection":[{"content":"EMBASE"}]},"head":{"citationInfo":{"citationType":[{"content":"Conference Abstract"}]},"citationTitle":{"titleText":[{"language":{"code":"en","content":"English"},"original":true,"ttltext":"Estimating the association between qt prolongation and SSRI utilization from the FDA's adverse event reports"}]},"authorGroup":[{"etAl":false},{"etAl":false}],"abstracts":{"abstracts":[{"original":true,"abstractLanguage":{"code":"en","content":"English"},"perspective":null,"publisherCopyright":null,"paras":["Background: Citalopram (Celexa®) is in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of antidepressants. It is taken orally. Citalopram has been linked to both QT prolongation and Torsade de pointes (TdP), and these risks may be dose related. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to analyze the association between QT prolongation and TdP adverse events and the utilization of citalopram and other SSRIs. Methods: This retrospective, descriptive study used the U.S. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The database included 7,840,225 adverse events associated with SSRI drugs from 1997 fourth quarter to 2011 third quarter. The number of reported QT-prolongation and TdP cases associated with each study drug was calculated over time. Furthermore, for each case, dosage of the drug, when available in the report, was noted. Results: A total of 1,192 reported cases of QT prolongation and TdP were associated with SSRI drugs over the 14-year study period. Only 18% (219) of the adverse event reports were related specifically to citalopram, while the rest were related to other SSRI drugs. There were 911 reports for women, 252 for men, and 29 reports without gender information. The rate of QT prolongation and TdP associated with dosages of 20, 40, and 60 mg of citalopram per day were 39%, 21%, and 2%, respectively. However, the percentage of reports without dosage information was 37%, so we were unable to draw any conclusions regarding dosage-related events. Conclusions: The results confirmed an association between the use of citalopram with QT prolongation and TdP. Furthermore, the association was not limited to citalopram alone but was widespread across the SSRIs. There were more adverse events observed for women than for men. Dose dependency was not established in this study. Future studies are warranted."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"Pharmacoepidemiol.

2019","paras":["Background: An increasing number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are available for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). QT prolongation is one of the known, but relatively rare, adverse events of several TKIs (e.g. osimertinib, crizotinib). Screening for QT prolongation in (high risk) patients is advised for these TKIs. When a QT prolongation develops, the physician is challenged with the question whether to (permanently) discontinue the TKI. Method: In this perspective, we report on a patient who developed a QT prolongation during icotinib (a first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]-TKI) treatment. Result: On discontinuation of icotinib, he developed a symptomatic disease flare, not responding to subsequent systemic treatment. The main aim of this perspective is to describe the management of QT prolongation in stage IV EGFR 19 deletion mutation NSCLC patients. We also discuss the ethical question of how to weigh the risk of a disease flare due to therapy cessation against the risk of sudden cardiac death. A family history of sudden death and a prolonged QT interval might indicate a familiar long QT syndrome. Conclusion: We have summarised the current monitoring advice for TKIs used in the treatment of lung cancer and the most common druge TKI interactions to consider and to optimise TKI treatment in EGFR mutation patients.

Sotalol is an antiarrhythmic agent that prolongs the cardiac action potential that can be observed as QT interval (QT) prolongation on the surface EKG. It is known that sotalol causes Torsade de Pointes ventricular tachycardia (TdP) that is due to dose related QT prolongation. We were able to develop a correlation betweenQTprolongation and sotalol serum concentration. Methods: 15 healthy volunteers (age: 32 ± 8 y) received 75 mg intravenous sotalol over 2.5 hr at a constant infusion rate. Serum sotalol concentrations were determined and a 12-lead EKG was recorded at baseline, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hrs following dosing. The QT and RR intervals were measured by two blinded investigators. Heart rate corrected QT (QTc) was calculated by the Bazett, Fridericia, and Framingham formulas. Linear regression analysis was performed between S concentration and QT measurements. Results: The analysis showed close correlation between sotalol serum concentration and QT (r=0.938, p<0.02), Bazett QTc (r=0.860, p<0.02), Framingham QTc (r=0.960, p=0.001), and Fridericia QTc (r=0.967, p<0.001). The equation of the regression line was: QTc= 0.0388 x (sotalol concentration) + 402.63, which closely predicted actual QTc at any sotalol concentration. Conversely any degree of QT prolongation can predict the measured serum sotalol concentration. Conclusion: A simple equation was found that predicts serum sotalol concentration from QT prolongation. Measuring QT prolongation can yield a quick method of estimating serum sotalol concentration, as well as the electrophysiologic effects of serum sotalol. Excessive serum sotalol levels that causes excessive QT prolongation can be avoided, possibly reducing the risk of TdP."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Journal of Investigative Medicine"],"sourceTitleAbbrev":"J.

(Celexa®) is in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of antidepressants. It is taken orally. Citalopram has been linked to both QT prolongation and Torsade de pointes (TdP), and these risks may be dose related. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the association between QT prolongation and TdP adverse events and the utilization of citalopram and other SSRIs. METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive study used the U.S. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The database included 7,840,225 adverse events associated with SSRI drugs from 1997 fourth quarter to 2011 third quarter. The number of reported QT-prolongation and TdP cases associated with each study drug was calculated over time. Furthermore, for each case, dosage of the drug, when available in the report, was noted. RESULTS: A total of 1192 reported cases of QT prolongation and TdP were associated with SSRI drugs over the 14-year study period. Only 18% (219) of the adverse event reports were related specifically to citalopram, while the rest were related to other SSRI drugs. There were 911 reports for women, 252 for men, and 29 reports without gender information. The rate of QT prolongation and TdP associated with dosages of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg of citalopram per day were 39%, 21%, and 2%, respectively. However, the percentage of reports without dosage information was 37%, so we were unable to draw any conclusions regarding dosage-related events. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed an association between the use of citalopram with QT prolongation and TdP. Furthermore, the association was not limited to citalopram alone but was widespread across the SSRIs. There were more adverse events observed for women than for men. Dose dependency was not established in this study.

The summary of product characteristics (SPC) is the most important (indirect) source of information for healthcare providers (HCP) to gain information on QT prolonging properties of drugs. However, we have noticed that information regarding QT prolongation varies between different products, which may hamper the uptake of the information. Objective: To systematically assess the number of products reporting an impact on QT interval in the SPC, and the variation in nature of the observed QT prolonging effect described and recommendations given to the HCP. Methods: The SPCs of products centrally approved in Europe between 1.1.2006 and 1.5.2012 were screened. Of those mentioning 'QT', we examined in which sections of the SPC 'QT prolongation' was mentioned. The nature of the message on QT prolongation and the advice on cautionary measures related to QT prolongation was examined as well as the relation between both. Results: Of the 172 screened products, 44 products contained information on QT in the SPC. QT related issues were most commonly reported in section 4.4 (special warnings and precautions, 66 %) and section 4.8 (undesirable effects, 57 %). In almost half of the products, the main message was that either the drug prolongs the QT interval (18 %), or potentially prolongs the QT interval (20 %). The SPC contained a negative message (the drug does not prolong the QT interval) in 23 % and no clear positive or negative message on QT prolongation in 39 % of the SPCs. Sixty-two percent of the SPCs gave the advice to act with caution in patients with QT related risk factors (n = 25), and 16 % explained the association of QT prolongation with ventricular arrhythmias (n = 27). The advice on monitoring of patients was given in 34 % of the SPCs (n = 15). Products that were more likely to have QT-prolonging properties according to the SPC provided more information on QT prolongation in the SPC. Conclusion: We observed that products, that were more likely to have QT prolonging properties according to the SPC, provided more information on QT prolongation in the SPC. We advise the development of a more extensive guideline concerning reporting on QT prolonging in SPCs, in order to guide prescribers more clearly."]}]},"source":{"sourceTitle":["Drug
